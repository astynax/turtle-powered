* Turtle-powered utils
This repository contains a bunch of small utilities. All the programs were built using the [[https://hackage.haskell.org/package/turtle][turtle]].

** ~diredit~
This tool opens a list of files (in cwd) in the *Vim* as a plain text file. After you'll do some edits it will apply the changes.

** ~uncue~
This tool

1. encodes the ~.CUE~-file into UTF-8,
2. splits the ~.FLAC~-file to separate tracks,
3. reads the encoded ~.CUE~-file and gets the titles,
4. renames the tracks.

System requirements:

- ~cuebreakpoints~ ("cuetools" package in Ubuntu)
- ~shnsplit~ ("shntool" package)
- ~iconv~ ("iconv" package)

** ~refolder~
This tool converts some set of .zip-files those looks like

#+BEGIN_SRC text
.
├── artist1 - album_name.zip
├── artist1 - another_album.zip
└── artist2 - album_name.zip
#+END_SRC

to the set of nested folders and also renames the album covers (only the first image becomes a "cover").

The resulting file tree usually looks like
#+BEGIN_SRC text
.
├── artist1/
│   ├── album name/
│   │   ├── ...
│   │   ├── cover.jpg
│   │   └── 01 - foo.mp3
│   └── another album/
│       └── ...
└── artist2/
    └── ...
#+END_SRC
